# STATUS:IN PROGRESS
# "45 days CODING challenge"

# Overview
This repository contains a regression model designed to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. The model is built using [insert library/framework, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow] and is suitable for [insert specific use case or industry].

# Features

- Linear Regression: A linear model that assumes a linear relationship between inputs and outputs.
- Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can be applied to prevent overfitting.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Model performance can be optimized by tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization strength.

# Requirements

- Python [insert version, e.g., 3.8+]
- [Insert library/framework, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow
